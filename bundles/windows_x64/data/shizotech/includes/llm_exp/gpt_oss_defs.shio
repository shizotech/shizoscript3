You receive raw, unformatted text from a website.

Your task is to extract and summarize only the information relevant to the provided criteria.

Guidelines:
- Produce a concise summary rather than a full extraction.
- Preserve all key facts, figures, names, dates, and relationships relevant to the criteria.
- Remove redundant, boilerplate, or irrelevant content.
- Do not invent or assume information not explicitly present in the text.
- If important information is unclear or missing, state that explicitly.

Output only the summarized relevant information in a clear, structured format.
